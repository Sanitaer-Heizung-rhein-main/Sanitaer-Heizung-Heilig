Arbitration<\/strong>.<\/p><div><p>13.1\u00a0<strong>Generally<\/strong>.\u00a0 In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Sponsor in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Sponsor agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Terms of Use and your use of, and access to, the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.\u00a0 Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\u00a0 Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\u00a0 Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\u00a0 Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Terms of Use, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Terms of Use.\u00a0 YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF USE, YOU AND SPONSOR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<\/p><p>13.2\u00a0<strong>Exceptions<\/strong>.\u00a0 Notwithstanding Section13.1, we both agree that nothing in this Terms of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to: (i)bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii)pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii)seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv)to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.<\/p><p>13.3\u00a0<strong>Arbitrator<\/strong>.\u00a0 Any arbitration between you and Sponsor \u00a0will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), as modified by this Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA.\u00a0 The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adr.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.adr.org<\/a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Sponsor.<\/p><p>13.4\u00a0<strong>Notice; Process<\/strong>.\u00a0 A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by submitting a form here:\u00a0<a href=\"\/contact\">TOS Contact<\/a>.\u00a0 The Notice must: (i)describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii)set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\u00a0 We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Sponsor \u00a0may commence an arbitration proceeding.\u00a0 During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Sponsor must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\u00a0 If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Sponsor will pay you: (a)the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (b)the last written settlement amount offered by Sponsor in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award; or (c)$1,000, whichever is greater.<\/p><p>13.5\u00a0<strong>Fees<\/strong>.\u00a0 If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Terms of Use, Sponsor will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\u00a0 Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Florida, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i)solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii)through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii)by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\u00a0 If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\u00a0 In such case, you agree to reimburse Sponsor \u00a0for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\u00a0 Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\u00a0 The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.
